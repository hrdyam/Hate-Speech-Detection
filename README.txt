Descriptive analysis of the dataset is in 'Data_Exploration.ipynb' file.
Data preprocessing and model implementation is in 'Bidirectional_LSTM_Model' file.

Steps to run the code 
----------------------

Data_Exploration.ipynb -  Can be run sequentially. Please make sure the training, test
and dev data sets are copied to this folder. They are not included.

Model Implementation - Since GloVe pre-trained models are used, along with datasets, glove.twitter.27B.zip  from	https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ should be included. The code can be run sequentially after that.
